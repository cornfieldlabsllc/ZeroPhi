Quick Summary
Computation is traditionally symbolic. This work reframes it as spectral thermodynamics: logic as flux compression, memory as geometry in stillness.

Key Ideas
Spectral Computing: inference via relaxation of violation energy
Zero Phi Memory: persistence without optimization (Phi(v) = 0)
Spectral Integrity Classifier (SIC): polynomial-time SAT decision via partition functions

CODEBASE AND DEMOS

The core architecture is implemented in two opposing regimes:

- ZeroPhiMemory.py (The Memory): Implements geometric storage (Phi = 0).
- SpectralComputation.py (The Engine): Implements flux-driven computation (Phi is not equal to 0).

HOW TO RUN THE DEMOS

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have the numpy library installed:

pip install numpy

2. Run the Interoperability Demo: This file provides the most complete test, demonstrating how a stable memory item can bias and resolve an uncertain computation query.

python Interoperability_Demo.py

Expected Outcome: The output will confirm the system stores a stable fixed point (e.g., v=10) and then resolves a mixed input (e.g., 80% uncertain query at v=30) back to the stable memory state (v_final=10), demonstrating the dominance of geometric invariance.
