Quick Summary
Computation is traditionally symbolic. This work reframes it as spectral thermodynamics: logic as flux compression, memory as geometry in stillness.

Key Ideas
Spectral Computing: inference via relaxation of violation energy
Zero Phi Memory: persistence without optimization (Phi(v) = 0)
Spectral Integrity Classifier (SIC): polynomial-time SAT decision via partition functions

Code
Python implementations coming soon in /code/.
